- [x] when you enter the review screen the chat gpt not configured
warning shows immediately, It should only show when the user clicks the
chat gpt button.

If I try to toggle any of the radio buttons they go back to their original
state.

shouldn't show up until the user clicks the ai button.  

- [x] The AI button should be the traditional wand with stars.

- [x] on the review screen, when you click create job, the screen 
should close.

customer/site/contact data from the clipboard - change 
that screen os if ai is enabled it use the ai to extract the details
and fall back to the existing regex method if ai isn't enabled.

- [x] Change the job add button so it does what the customer add button
does but also extract the summary and task extraction from the booking
request.
