# the heart of HMB
HMB is based around Jobs. 
A Job represents work for a customer at a specific site.

Within a Job you create the set of Tasks that make up the parts of a Job.
Time tracking and costings are done against a task but totaled to the Job.

Each Task can have:
* Notes about the task
* Status of the task
* Estimates based on time or cost
* Time tracking entries - used to generate invoices when using the 'Time and Materials' billing method.
* Annotated photos
* track hours worked on the Task
